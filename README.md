# PII Detector Add-On

One can provide this add-on a set of documents and it will search through the pages for personally identifying information(PII), and annotate the corresponding pages in the document where possible personally identifying information appears. There is also the option to add the documents that have PII detected in them to a specific project folder and the ability to receive an email notification when the AddOn is complete. It currently detects the following types of PII:

- Social Security Numbers
- Credit Card numbers
- Phone numbers
- Emails 
- Street addresses and po boxes
- Zip codes
